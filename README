Safsi is a simple abstract file system interface for PHP. The goal is to
provide a simple interface for accessing files in a consistent way,
whether dealing with file locally on disk or dealing with files that
exist remotely. For example, the same code should work for data stored
on a local disk, data stored on s3 and data stored on CloudFiles.
